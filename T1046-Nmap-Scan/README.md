# 🛡️ MITRE ATT&CK T1046 – Network Scanning Detection Lab

This project simulates and detects adversary behavior using `nmap` for stealthy network scanning. Detection is performed using `Zeek`, and logs are ingested and visualized with `Filebeat` and the Elastic Stack.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To emulate a real-world **MITRE ATT&CK Technique T1046** – *Network Service Scanning* – and detect the activity using Zeek logs and visual analysis in Kibana.

## 🔧 Tools Used

| Tool         | Purpose                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Nmap**     | Stealth SYN scan simulation          |
| **Zeek**     | Capture connection logs              |
| **Filebeat** | Ship logs to Elastic Cloud           |
| **Kibana**   | Visualize attacker behavior          |
| **Elastic Cloud** | Hosted SIEM + log analytics     |

## ⚙️ Attack Simulation

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -T4 192.168.64.0/24
Simulates stealth network discovery (TCP SYN scan)

Zeek logs the connections in conn.log

Filebeat forwards logs to Elastic Cloud

🔍 Detection Artifacts
Zeek conn.log showed multiple connections with state S0 (SYN sent, no response)

Single source IP scanned multiple ports/hosts

Kibana dashboard created to visualize scanning behavior

📊 Kibana Visualization
📁 File: screenshots/donut_dashboard.png

This donut chart visualizes Top Source IPs by connection volume. The attacker (192.168.64.28) was responsible for over 50% of the connection attempts, consistent with active scanning behavior.
